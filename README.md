## About the Project

> This is my personal portfolio that I have decided to build
> using Next, Tailwind, Node and Framer Motion. The overall goal
> was to provide myself a centralised location whereby
> customers/employers can quickly have an overview of my
> highlighted projects through a clean and performant porfolio
> website.
